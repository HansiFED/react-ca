Wesell is my latest project at Noroff where our task was to build an E-com site with some required user stories.

Wesell offers a smooth and seamless experience navigating the site, add items to cart, checkout and look at individual products and contact the store.

## Product page:

For the product page I went with a clean and minimalistic look. The reviews can be clicked from a dropdown and you can add the product to cart easily

## Cart page: 
For the cart page there are two states that are possible. Empty cart or items in the cart. 

For the empty cart you will be greeted with a very simple but effective "Your cart is empty screen"

While for when you have products added, it will loook like this.

And lastly you have a contact us screen with some forms that have form validation implemented as per required user stories.

All in all a very fun project to work with and I look forward to using react more in my future programming journey. 



# How to run the project:

## Installing dependencies and running the project

- When you first clone the repo and open it in VSCode its important that you run ```npm install``` in the terminal.

- Once you have done that you can now run ```npm build``` in the terminal which will build the project for you.

- Then, if you'd like to make changes or see the project in real time you will have to run ```npm run dev``` to open up a 'liveserver' where all the possible changes to the project you do will be displayed in real time.
